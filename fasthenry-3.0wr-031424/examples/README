input
This contains a number of example FastHenry input files and other
examples.

run
This script, with no arguments, will run the examples in ./input,
placing results in a directory named "output" which will be created
if necessary.  Arguments can be paths to FastHenry input files,
which will be run, and results saved in ./output.

cf
This script, with no arguments, will compare the inductance matrix
files found in ./output to saved results in ./results/linux_sparse.

results
Saved results from the examples for each linear algebra package
for which such data exists.

torture
Another input file that takes a long time to run when using the
Sparse solver.
