Title:
*  A fasthenry input file for a nonuniform ground plane

all lengths multiplied by 1 to convert to meters
Total number of filaments before multipole refine: 56
DivideSegs: Warning: tried to divide an indivisable segment.
  Segment length: 0.250000,  maximum allowed length: 0.126250  The segment is probably part of a ground plane.
  If so, decrease the partitioning level by 1 or refine the ground plane
Total number of filaments after multipole refine: 56
